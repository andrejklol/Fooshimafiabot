# ✨ Features

## 🧹 Sal Mancini — AI Character Bot
Meet **Sal Mancini**, the Fooshi Social Club's janitor since 1987. He knows where the bodies are because he cleaned up after them.

Powered by **Google Gemini**, Sal is a fully stateful AI character who responds in-character to any mention. He remembers conversations, holds grudges, tracks who keeps pestering him, and has spent thirty-eight years mopping floors for people who forget he's in the room.

* **Rank-Aware Responses:** Sal's tone shifts based on your server role — deferential to the Don, careful around the Consigliere, annoyed by Soldiers, outright contemptuous of Associates.
* **Escalating Lore:** Ask about Room 4 enough times and he'll tell you. Ask about the briefcase enough times and he'll tell you that too. He has a limit.
* **Stateful Memory:** Per-user conversation history, persistent grudge logs, pester counters, and an enemies list — all saved across restarts.
* **Daily Reports:** Sal drops an automated maintenance log every morning at 9am. It is never normal.
* **Gloria Escalation, Briefcase Escalation, Room 4 Escalation:** Three separate story threads that deepen the more you push.

---

## 📊 Staff Activity & Live Syncing
Automatically tracks moderation actions using VRChat audit logs, Discord events, and live web activity signals.
* **Tracked Actions:** Warns, Kicks, Bans, Invites, Invite Accepts, and Staff Activity Scoring.
* **Web Integration:** Features a real-time **Reflection Layer** that securely pushes fresh presence and audit payloads to your web instance every 30–60 seconds.
* **Data Integrity:** Restarts safely without data loss, maintaining sync between Discord roles, VRChat group membership, and database states.

---

## 🏆 Leaderboard System
Ranks staff performance using an activity-based scoring system, visible across both Discord commands and the web panel.
* **Scale:** Built to reliably manage massive active data sets (simultaneously tracking **1,700+ leaderboard metrics**).
* **Includes:** Global leaderboard tracking, automated monthly resets, individual staff analytics, and persistent storage.

**Commands**

```text
/leaderboard
/staffrecord @user
```

---

## 🛡️ Advanced Security & Automation
Equipped with proactive defensive tools to automate day-to-day community safety and server maintenance.
* **Auto-Lockdown Protection:** Dynamically monitors joining patterns. Detects malicious server raids via sudden, calculated spikes in joins + bans, automatically locking invite channels and restricting public text channels.
* **Smart Overrides:** Easily toggled off via dashboard configurations during official community events to prevent false-alarm lockdowns from legitimate member surges.

---

## 🚨 Repeat Offender Detection & Thresholds
Automatically tracks users who repeatedly violate community rules and triggers automated alerts when thresholds are breached.
* **Configurable Infraction Ceilings:** Automatically flags and moves a user to the "Repeat Offender" profile roster upon hitting their limit (Default: **5 infractions**).
* **Daily Burst Monitoring:** Tracks system-wide action frequencies per day to flag potential issues early:
    * **Warns Burst:** Triggers alert at **3 daily warns**.
    * **Kicks Burst:** Triggers alert at **2 daily kicks**.
    * **Bans Burst:** Triggers immediate alert at **1 daily ban**.

---

## 🌐 VRChat API Integration
Direct, high-fidelity integration with official VRChat group endpoints.
* **Robust Session Management:** Leverages a **Live-Login with a persisted session strategy** featuring custom OTP (One-Time Password) validation to maintain continuous API connectivity.
* **Active Tracking:** Monitors **1,900+ real-time VRChat status entries** to deliver instant member visibility.

---

## 🧠 Status Pipeline System
Advanced online detection system combining multiple infrastructure signals for accurate staff presence tracking.

### Tier 1 — Highest Reliability
* WebSocket presence signals
* VRChat friend presence updates

### Tier 2
* Recent moderation actions
* Audit log actor activity markers

### Tier 3
* VRChat user status configurations
* Supported external platform signals

---

## 🎫 Automated Ticket DM System
Eliminates manual notification overhead for administrative support channels.
* **Instant Routing:** The moment a staff member replies inside a private ticket channel, the bot automatically resolves the ticket owner's details from the web database layer.
* **Direct-to-User Messages:** Instantly fires a direct message to the user notifying them that a staff member has responded, dropping a convenient link back to their ticket.
